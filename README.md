# ML-Cancer-Classification

<i>Using Python</i> 

The fundamental biology of cancer is characterized by progressive and accumulated mutations that lead to the degeneration of cellular checks and balances controlling cell proliferation, entrance to the cell cycle, and programmed cell death. However, while the inherent patterns of cancer cell formation follows this general pattern, there are signifcant cell-type to cell-type variations that affect clinical outcomes and prognoses. This project therefore investigates the differences in gene expression among cancers of various tissue origin. 

Using the dataset from "The Human Protein Atlas", the unique expression levels of 16333 genes are feature selected and analyzed for cancer prediction probabilities using One-Class Support Vector Machines (OC-SVM), Isolation Forest and neural networks.
